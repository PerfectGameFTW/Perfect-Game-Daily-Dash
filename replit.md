# Perfect Game Sales Tracker

## Overview
A full-stack dashboard that syncs and visualizes daily sales, revenue, and gift card activity from the Square Payments API.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TanStack Query + shadcn/ui (Vite dev server)
- **Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- **Timezone**: UTC stored in DB; Eastern Time boundaries applied at query time via `getEasternDateRange` in `server/dateUtils.ts`

## Key Features
- Real-time sales dashboard with daily/weekly/monthly/custom date ranges
- Gift card sales tracking with activation amounts from Square Gift Card Activities API
- Nightly automatic sync at 3 AM Eastern Time (via `node-cron` scheduler)
- Admin panel: user management + data sync controls (full catch-up sync)
- "Last synced" indicator in dashboard header

## Data Sync Architecture
Two sync paths co-exist (legacy and service-based):
- **Legacy**: `server/routes.ts` — handles `/api/simple-sync`, `/api/full-sync`
- **Service-based**: `server/routes/api.ts` + `server/services/syncService.ts`

Sync types:
- `payments` — Square payment transactions
- `orders` — Square orders (line items, totals)
- `giftCards` — All active Square gift cards; activation amounts from Activities API
- `giftCardRedemptions` — Gift card usage linked to transactions
- `refunds` — Square refunds via the dedicated Refunds API (separate from payments)

### Scheduled Sync
`server/services/schedulerService.ts` runs every 5 minutes + nightly at 3 AM ET:
1. Gift card full sync (all active cards)
2. Payments sync (last 3 days nightly / last 15 min frequent)
3. Orders sync (last 3 days nightly / last 15 min frequent)
4. Refunds sync (last 3 days nightly / last 15 min frequent)
5. Activation amount backfill via Gift Card Activities API

### Historical Catch-up
`POST /api/sync/historical` — starts a background process that chunks through monthly date ranges from a given start date through today, syncing orders, payments, and refunds for each chunk, then runs a full gift card sync and activation backfill.

### Gift Card Historical Backfill (Task #4 fix)
`POST /api/sync/gift-cards-backfill` — resumable backfill that pages through ALL Square ACTIVATE events oldest-first via the Activities API. Saves a cursor checkpoint after every page so restarts resume mid-scan. Each call processes up to 20 pages (1,000 events). Call repeatedly until `finished: true` is returned. This fixes the March 9-20 gap where 228 cards were missed because `listGiftCards` has no date filter and lost pagination progress on server restart.

## Gift Card Activation Amounts
Fixed in Task #1. Root cause was that `activation_amount` was being set from current balance (wrong for spent cards). Now uses Square Gift Card Activities API (`ACTIVATE` events) as the authoritative source.

Key function: `server/squareClient.ts → fetchGiftCardActivitiesMap()` — returns `Map<squareId, amountDollars>`.

Repair/backfill: `server/services/enhancedGiftCardFix.ts → backfillGiftCardActivationAmounts()`.

## Bugs Fixed in Task #4 (March 9-20 gift card data gap)
1. **Bug 1 (PRIMARY)**: `syncGiftCards()` used `listGiftCards` API with no cursor checkpoint — server restarts lost pagination progress, leaving March 9-20 cards unreachable. Fixed by adding `syncGiftCardsHistoricalBackfill()` using Activities API with saved cursor.
2. **Bug 2 (field name)**: `syncService.ts` was setting `currentBalance` instead of `amount` in nightly full sync updates (silent no-op since `currentBalance` doesn't exist in schema). Fixed to use `amount`.
3. **Bug 3 (timezone)**: `convertSquareGiftCardToGiftCard()` called `toZonedTime()` which stored Eastern local time with UTC label (off by 4-5 hours). Fixed to store raw UTC directly from Square's `createdAt`. Historical backfill re-writes existing records with correct UTC timestamps.
4. **Bug 4 (schema drift)**: `activation_payment_id` column existed in DB but not in Drizzle schema. Added `activationPaymentId: integer("activation_payment_id")` to `shared/schema.ts`.

## Refund & Return Tracking (Task #10)
Root cause: Dashboard showed $0.00 refunds because it checked for negative payment amounts, but Square stores refunds as separate API objects (not negative payments). Fixed by:
1. Added `refunds` DB table (`shared/schema.ts`) with fields: squareRefundId, squarePaymentId, amount, status, reason (nullable), createdAt, squareData
2. Added `fetchRefunds()` in `server/squareClient.ts` using Square's `RefundsApi.listPaymentRefunds()`
3. Added `syncRefunds()` to `syncService.ts`, wired into both 5-min and nightly sync schedules
4. Updated `dashboardService.ts` to query refunds table instead of checking negative payment amounts
5. Backfilled 843 historical refunds from Jan 1, 2025

**Refunds vs Returns (CRITICAL — these are two completely separate things in Square)**:
Square treats refunds and returns as distinct objects. They are queried separately and must always be tracked separately in the database and backend, even when the UI combines them for display purposes.
- **Refunds**: Refund records with NO reason field. Represents a straight money-back refund. The full refund amount is used.
- **Returns**: Refund records WITH a reason field (e.g., "Accidental Charge"). Represents returned items. The amount used is pre-tax (total refund minus return tax, looked up from order's `returnAmounts.taxMoney`).
- **Taxes**: Reduced by the tax portion of returns (from order-level `returnAmounts.taxMoney`).
- The `getDetailedTransactionBreakdown()` in `dashboardService.ts` queries refunds and returns with separate SQL queries (filtering by `reason IS NULL` vs `reason IS NOT NULL`).
- The `getRevenueBreakdown()` in `paymentService.ts` queries ALL refunds (both types combined) for the True Revenue calculation.
- The Summary Stats UI may combine them for display (e.g., "Refunds + Returns" line), but the underlying data must always keep them separate for other views that break them out individually.

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/summary` — daily summary (revenue, gift card sales, order count)
- `GET /api/gift-card-summary` — gift card sold/redeemed totals for a date range
- `GET /api/sync/status` — last sync timestamps per type
- `POST /api/sync/historical` — trigger background full catch-up sync (orders/payments)
- `POST /api/sync/gift-cards-backfill` — resumable gift card historical backfill (call until finished=true)
- `POST /api/fix-gift-cards` — re-run activation amount backfill
- `GET /api/analyze-gift-cards` — gift card coverage statistics
